## Description<a name="description"></a>

The Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Starbucks Capstone project is compromised of simulated data, containing offer portfolio details, customer profile details, and transcripts of interactions from the Starbucks rewards mobile app.

The task is to combine the available datasets and determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer types.

Potential Business Questions:

What offers and offer types tend to perform well and why?
Which, if any, demographic groups can be identified in relation to responsiveness to offers?
Inversely, which offers/demographics do not perform/respond well?
If an appropriate model can be created, which metric should be addressed for optimization?

### Conclusions <a name="Conclusions"></a>

Using a StackingClassifier, the model will be able to increase the efficacy to about 74% of likely responsive customers from the original amount of 38%.
I strongly believe that improvements can be made in a few areas, namely preprocessing and model fitting.
